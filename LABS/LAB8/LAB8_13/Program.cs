            /* Write a program that calculates and displays the yearly amount available if $1,000 
             * is invested in a bank account for 10 years. Your program should display the amounts 
             * available for interest rates from 6 percent to 12 percent inclusively, at 1 percent 
             * increments. Use a nested loop, with the outer loop having a fixed count of 7 and the 
             * inner loop a fixed count of 10. The first iteration of the outer loop should use an 
             * interest rate of 6 percent and display the amount of money available at the end of 
             * the first 10 years. In each subsequent pass through the outer loop, the interest 
             * rate should be increased by 1 percent. Use the relationship that the money available 
             * at the end of each year equals the amount of money in the account at the start of the 
             * year plus the interest rate times the amount available at the start of the year.
             * [The output of this program should be in the form of a table] */
